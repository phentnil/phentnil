# 👋 Hi, I'm @phentnil

## 👀 I'm interested in:

- Web development
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Python
- Artificial Intelligence
  - Neural networks
  - Genetic algorithms
  - Machine learning

## 🌱 I'm currently learning:

**TypeScript** as a new way to expand on my knowledge of JavaScript. As the description and overall behavior of TS goes, it's very constraining, but it has helped me learn more about being a better programmer!

## 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on:

- JavaScript projects (Node.js, TypeScript, React, and others)
- Python projects
- Node.js module development (not much experience learned there yet, but I'm a quick study!)
- *Other suggestions?*
